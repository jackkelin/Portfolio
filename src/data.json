I collaborated with our director of development and a third-party designer to bring to life a robust Drupal 7 site. The requirements were out of the scope of a traditional Drupal site but with the help of Drupal's contrib modules: Entity and Paragraphs, we built a highly flexible site where content administrator's can easily compose web pages in different layouts, not constrained to a fixed template. During the process, I defined front-end build tools and established new techniques to solve challenges and allow for pivots along the way.",
